# Link Cable Splitter for Faceball 2000 on Game Boy

These are the Altium Designer source files and Gerber files for the prototype buffered link cable splitter we used to play Faceball 2000's legendary 16 player mode. These are _not_ the ones made in the '90s by Robert Champagne and the team at Xanth Software F/X, but we believe it's close to what they wanted to ship with the game.

For a full sixteen player game, you will need:
- 14 splitters
- 29 link cables
